                <h2>About the German Shepherd Dog</h2>

<q>German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, 
presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. 
The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch
or two and reach great speeds.

There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine 
royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, 
confidence, the ability to learn commands
for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of 
loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, 
but, the breed standard says, there’s a “certain aloofness that does not lend itself 
to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.</q>
